# Jazzband

This is a Flask app that renders https://jazzband.co.

It's mostly a copy of [add-to-org] since I couldn't figure out how to do a
few things with Sinatra.

It also renders Markdown based documentation for the Jazzband.

[![Requirements Status](https://requires.io/github/jazzband/site/requirements.svg?branch=master)](https://requires.io/github/jazzband/site/requirements/?branch=master)

## Installation

Assuming you have a Python stack installed, run `make install`. This will
create a virtualenv in the folder of you checkout and install all required
Python dependencies.

## Running

Run `make run` to run the development server.
