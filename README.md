The code that renders https://jazzband.co.

## Installation

Copy `.env-dist` to `.env`.

Install Docker and NPM.

Run `make build`. This will create a set of Docker containers with all backends
and dependencies.

The Jazzband site uses a self-signed TLS certificate for development to be able
to reproduce the production environment as close as possible. To that effect
it's required to install [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)
in your system's certificate trust store (once). To do that install `mkcert`
by following the installation instructions and then run `make trust`.

In case the embedded self-signed certificates are outdated you can recreate
them by running `make cert`.

## Running

Run `make run` to run the development server and worker. The website will be available
at https://localhost:5000.
