      One more step needed to become a full Jazzband member:
    </p>
    <p>
      You've successfully logged in using GitHub but haven't become
      a member of the
      <a href="https://github.com/jazzband">Jazzband GitHub organization</a>
      just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please allow us first to send you an invitation via email to join our
      GitHub organization and then – as a security precaution – follow the
      instructions in the email from GitHub to accept the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="{{ url_for('account.join') }}">Send invitation to join now</a>
    </p>
  </div>
  {% endif %}
  <p>
    We fetched some data about you from the
    <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a> to be able to
    display the <a href="{{ url_for('members.index') }}">members list</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, your GitHub login is <b>{{ current_user.login }}</b>,
    your GitHub account can be found <a href="{{ current_user.html_url }}">here</a>
    and your Avatar image <a href="{{ current_user.avatar_url }}">here</a>.
  </p>
{#}  <h4>Projects</h4>
  <p>
    {% if current_user.projects_memberships.scalar() %}
    The project(s) you're a member of. If you are a project lead
    in one of them you can do releases to PyPI as well.
    <ul>
      {% for project_membership in current_user.projects_memberships %}
        <li>
          <a href="{{ url_for('projects.detail', name=project_membership.project.name) }}">{{ project_membership.project.name }}</a>
          {% if project_membership.is_lead %} (lead){% endif %}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  {% else %}
    You haven't joined any project so far, do you <a href="{{ url_for('projects.index') }}">want to do that now</a>?
    If not, that's okay, you're still part of the band.
  {% endif %}
  </p>

  <h4>What's next?</h4>
  <p>
    You may be wondering what you can do as a member of the Jazzband.
    And that's a fair question since this site doesn't provide much
    specific work to do by itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    All code work happens in our
    <a href="https://github.com/jazzband">GitHub organization</a>. Feel free
    to head over there to see a list of projects, or see the same data on the
    <a href="{{ url_for('projects.index') }}">project index</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may also find the <a href="{{ url_for('members.index') }}">member list</a>
    and <a href="{{ url_for('members.roadies') }}">roadies list</a> useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't miss the <a href="{{ url_for('content.about', path='faq') }}">FAQ</a>,
    <a href="{{ url_for('content.news') }}">news section</a> and please
    <a href="{{ url_for('content.about', path='contact') }}">reach out</a>
    to fellow Jazzband members if needed.
  </p>

      </dt>
      <dd>{{ projects_membership.project.description }}</dd>
    {% endfor %}
  </dl>
  </p>
  {% else %}
  <p>
    You haven't joined a project team yet, would you like to do that now?
    Head over to the <a href="{{ url_for('projects.index') }}">project index</a>
    and select one of the projects you're interested in.

  <p>
    Here are the email addresses we fetched using the GitHub API to make sure
    you have verified at least one:
