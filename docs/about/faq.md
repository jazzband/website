title: FAQ

### What's the purpose of the Jazzband?

The purpose of the Jazzband is to help Open Source projects on GitHub
share responsibility for software maintenance. It's essentially a GitHub
organization that is open to everyone who is willing and able to maintain
its projects. It was born out of necessity of expanding the group of
maintainers of some projects whose original authors weren't able to
effectively manage them when people volunteered to help out.

In that sense it's hoped that opening the contribution process will lower
the barrier of entry for new contributors and reduce the stress that comes
with receiving commit access to a project by spreading it to a bigger group.

**"We are all part of this"** means that we share the responsibilties of
open source software development, including dreaming big, acting positively
and failing sometimes. It'll be okay since we're not alone.

### How do I join the Jazzband?

First [login with GitHub](/account/login) and then follow the instructions
on your [account dashboard](/account).

### Does the Jazzband have a code of conduct?

Yes, the Jazzband follows a [Contributor Code of Conduct](/about/conduct)
that was adopted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org).
Please refer to the conduct page for more information for how to report a
breach of conduct.

### How do I report a security incident?

See the [contact page](/about/contact#security).

### How do releases to the Python Package Index work?

Please refer to the separate [releases](/about/releases) page.

### How do I leave the Jazzband again?

Simply head to your [account dashboard](/account), click on "leave"
(or directly [here](/account/leave)) and confirm that you want to leave by
entering your GitHub username.

You can re-join anytime, simply [login](/account/login) and then
click on the "Send invitation" link on your [account dashboard](/account).

!!! note "Data retention"

    We retain some information about your previous membership to simplify the
    ability to join again.

    If you want to delete all Jazzband data about you that was fetched from the
    GitHub API, please let the [roadies](/roadies) know.

**Alternatively** you can remove yourself from the Jazzband GitHub organization
on your [personal settings](https://github.com/settings/organizations) over at
GitHub. There you can see the GitHub organizations you're a member of and easily
leave the Jazzband by clicking on the "Leave" button next to it.

### What do I do when I see abuse happening on any Jazzband repo?

Please open an issue for the [roadies](/roadies). If it's a matter
of urgency or discretion you may also want to write an email to
`roadies@jazzband.co` instead – especially if it's a breach of
conduct following our [code of conduct](/about/conduct).

### What's in it for the roadies?

Nothing, if you mean monetary compensation. The roadies are volunteers
just like other contributors.

### How do I disable email notifications for Jazzband repositories?

You may want to modify your notification settings on GitHub in your
[personal settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications).

Especially GitHub's feature **"Automatic watching"** can create lots of
notification traffic in big GitHub organizations. Feel free to disable it
and watch individual projects manually instead.

Alternatively you can also [ignore repositories] and continue to receive
notifications for the rest of your [watched repositories].

### Why am I not listed as an organization member on GitHub?

By default GitHub will set your Jazzband organization membership as private
and you have to change it to public if you'd like to be publicly shown
as member of the organization on
[github.com/jazzband](https://github.com/jazzband). You can fix it like this:

- Login into GitHub
- Head over to the
  [organization's people site](https://github.com/orgs/jazzband/people)
- Search for your nickname in the "Find a member..." field
- Change the "Organization visibility" setting from "Private" to "Public"
